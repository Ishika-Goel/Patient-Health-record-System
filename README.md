# Patient-Health-Record-System
The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less and providing low-cost reliable automation of a reliable existing system. The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of user-system interaction and provides robust and reliable storage and backup facilities

# ABSTACT
The purpose and essence of any records management system is to provide the right information in the right place, in the right order, at the right time for the right person at the lowest cost. 
This is better achieved by a computer-based system. There are some patient record management information systems (PRMISs) in existence, but they are not readily usable nor are their designs available for improvement.
 The main objective of this research was ,to design and develop a patient record management information system that would automate patient information management and give direct benefit in certain terms, whilst avoiding any confusion that would jeopardize the quality of patient care.
 The research strategy was design and creation, and the software development model used was the waterfall. The design and implementation of patient record management information system is presented, a veritable stepping stone.

# INTRODUCTION
Hospital is the essential part of our lives which provides us with the best medical facilities for various sickness, it may be due to the change in climatic conditions, stress (emotional trauma) etc.
 It is necessary for the hospital to keep track of all activities and records day in and day out of its patient, doctors, nurses, and other staffs that keeps the hospital in its operation. 
Keeping records on paper is a traditional base system that sometimes do not make it robust, in any case of damage all files will be lost that will cost a lot to the organization. 
Patient Health Record System is designed specifically to manage the records carefully and securely.

# MOTIVATION
The motivation behind patient health record system is to provide a complete and accurate description of the patient's medical history. This includes medical conditions, diagnoses, the care and treatment you provide, and results of such treatments.well-documented medical record reflects all clinically relevant aspects of the patient’s health and serves as an effective communication vehicle.

# LITERATURE REVIEW
As we have known, timely and accurate information is very vital to the success and growth of any organization especially in the health sector. The right information at the right time and in the right place helps to make a better management decision. Hence, “better information will lead to better treatment.”
Research shows that keeping records of clients who visit hospital facilities is one of the most studies of hospital irrespective of the capacities and the nature of activities that take place in such health facilities. 
Record keeping is a systematic way of entering, processing, analyzing, distributing, storing and retrieving information for an ultimate goal.
Electronic Patient health record system co-ordinate the storage and retrieval of individual record with aid of computer.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
•	One of the major problem in the traditional paper based system is time and space wastage.



•	In order to increase the efficiency of managing patient details and provide the securable environment for a long time period, we chose this project
