# Patient-Health-Record-System
The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less and providing low-cost reliable automation of a reliable existing system. The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of user-system interaction and provides robust and reliable storage and backup facilities

# ABSTACT
The purpose and essence of any records management system is to provide the right information in the right place, in the right order, at the right time for the right person at the lowest cost. 
This is better achieved by a computer-based system. There are some patient record management information systems (PRMISs) in existence, but they are not readily usable nor are their designs available for improvement.
 The main objective of this research was ,to design and develop a patient record management information system that would automate patient information management and give direct benefit in certain terms, whilst avoiding any confusion that would jeopardize the quality of patient care.
 The research strategy was design and creation, and the software development model used was the waterfall. The design and implementation of patient record management information system is presented, a veritable stepping stone.

# INTRODUCTION
Hospital is the essential part of our lives which provides us with the best medical facilities for various sickness, it may be due to the change in climatic conditions, stress (emotional trauma) etc.
 It is necessary for the hospital to keep track of all activities and records day in and day out of its patient, doctors, nurses, and other staffs that keeps the hospital in its operation. 
Keeping records on paper is a traditional base system that sometimes do not make it robust, in any case of damage all files will be lost that will cost a lot to the organization. 
Patient Health Record System is designed specifically to manage the records carefully and securely.

# MOTIVATION
The motivation behind patient health record system is to provide a complete and accurate description of the patient's medical history. This includes medical conditions, diagnoses, the care and treatment you provide, and results of such treatments.well-documented medical record reflects all clinically relevant aspects of the patient’s health and serves as an effective communication vehicle.

# LITERATURE REVIEW
As we have known, timely and accurate information is very vital to the success and growth of any organization especially in the health sector. The right information at the right time and in the right place helps to make a better management decision. Hence, “better information will lead to better treatment.”
Research shows that keeping records of clients who visit hospital facilities is one of the most studies of hospital irrespective of the capacities and the nature of activities that take place in such health facilities. 
Record keeping is a systematic way of entering, processing, analyzing, distributing, storing and retrieving information for an ultimate goal.
Electronic Patient health record system co-ordinate the storage and retrieval of individual record with aid of computer.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
•	One of the major problem in the traditional paper based system is time and space wastage.

•	In order to increase the efficiency of managing patient details and provide the securable environment for a long time period, we chose this project.

# PATIENT HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM
•	A Patient health record system is an organized collection of patient and population stored health information in digital composition.

•	These records can be shared over different health care settings. Records can be shared through network-connected, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges. 

•	These systems may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information.

# OBJECTIVES
•		To computerize all details regarding patient and hospital details.Scheduling the appointment of patient with doctors to make it convenient for both.

•	Scheduling the services of specialized doctors and emergency properly so that facilities provided by hospital are fully utilized in effective and efficient manner.
The information of the patients should be kept up to date and there record should be kept in the system for historical purposes.

# METHODOLOGY
The ‘Patient Health Record System’ is based on the database, Object-oriented programming language and networking techniques. MySQL is used in areas where keeping records in the database is necessary. This system uses C++ as the front-end software which is an object-oriented programming language technique and has connectivity with MYSQL, the back end software.

 Analysis:
 
•System planning and initial investigation.

•Information gathering

•Applying analysis tool for structured analysis

•Feasibility study

•Cost/benefit analysis

# OBJECT-ORIENTED ANALYSIS
•	The main objective of object oriented analysis to describe what the new system will do using the following major steps;

 		• Class modelling 
   
	 	• Use-Case 
   
	        • Dynamic modelling
   
•	Class modelling diagram are wisely used to describe the types of  object in a system and their relationship.

•	Use-case modelling This is a set of scenario that describe an interaction between a system and a user .The main component of the use case diagram are use case and actors. 
  It uses diagram to displays the relationship among actors and use case. 
  
 # DATABASE DESIGN
 
•	The database had to be designed in a particular manner, as one of the core elements of any management information system. The entities about which data is required include the Patient, Staff, Appointment, Prescription, Departments, Patient Diagnosis History, Patient Family Medical History, Patient Medical History, Admission, Wards.

•	This process started at the analysis phase of the project, to identify the necessary entities and relations, and their attributes, leading to determination of tables required for the database and the associated field names, format and length of each table.

# CONCLUSION
•	Computers are finding their way into every business, industry and research activity today. The use of computers is diverse, such as in entertainment, education, problem solving, research, personal management, among others. In hospitals, the process of maintaining the record of patients and employees working in the hospital, calculating bills, and so on, requires processing and record keeping in different departments.

•	Keeping in view a strong need for managing the various important information fast and efficiently, Patient Information Management System (PIMS) has been designed and developed. Proper analysis and assessment of the developed system indicates an efficient, usable and reliable records-management system, which adequately meets the minimum expectations that were set for it initially. 

•	The application scope, though, could be widened to accommodate entire hospital records management. The system can also be further enhanced so that the patients themselves can be able to access their information in a secure manner for the purpose of greater doctor-patient transparency.
